# growth_curves
Measure the exponential growth rate and carrying capacity of each strain.
* `data`:
   + `gc_midlog_raw_data.csv`: Optical densities at each set up stage, including overnight incubations and mid log phase before seeding experiment
   + `gc_curve_raw_data.csv`: Optical densities during growth curve measurements
* `growth_curves.Rmd`: R code for analyzing growth curve data and calculating exponential growth rate and carrying capacity
