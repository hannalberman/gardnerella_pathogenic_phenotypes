# biofilm
Measure the biofilm production of each straing using percent OD of biofilm growth and safranin staining.
* `data`:
   + `biofilm_midlog_raw_data.csv`: Optical densities at each set up stage, including overnight incubations and mid log phase before seeding experiment
   + `biofilm_od_raw_data.csv`: Optical densities of biofilm growth
   + `planktonic_od_raw_data.csv`: Optical densities of planktonic growth
   + `safranin_biofilm_raw_data.csv`: Optical densities of safranin stained biofilm growth
   + `safranin_planktonic_raw_data.csv`: Optical densities of planktonic growth on safranin stained plate
* `biofilm_formation.Rmd`: R code for analyzing biofilm formation
